 this is how pages and manifest files are served using git hub first I added the manifest then after app review i was told to add content type header but I dont know how so i created a .htacess file and they told me to add the content type again then I added the content type to the manifest itself.The app  has still been rejected even after adding what i think to be the content type header to the files.
 
 Today 6/10/2015 i have updated the manifest url on the firefox market place from https://github.com/nuwe1/nuwe1.github.io/blob/master/manifest.webapp to http://nuwe1.github.io/manifest.webapp hoping this will work now .
